Random Lines on my Cat, Pixie:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The cat, dropped the hat on the mat to capture the rat and eat it raw.
She ate it alive while it ‘as begging for its life; surely there are no animal rights in the cats’ law.                          
The cat saw that I saw her sawing the mice with her left canine. After that she took the rest of it and elsewhere did she dine.
Now she is sitting in front of me watching me as I type this making an innocent face.
No matter how much I like my cat, or she like me back,  we surely disagree on our tastes.
