#+DESCRIPTION: Disagreement on a popular quote
#+TITLE: Time is not a healer
Was just thinking the other day, many people believe and say that
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Time is the greatest healer. -- Anonymous
#+END_QUOTE
But I differ in opinion and as I analyzed it, this is a big illusion.
Rather I think that
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Time is no healer, itâ€™s just a popular anesthetic.
#+END_QUOTE
I think it is pretty much understood what I meant by the above lines.
Give a thought to it.
